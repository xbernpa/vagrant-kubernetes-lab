# vagrant-kubernetes-lab
This project is to provide a simple local Kubernetes cluster with a master and a worker node for testing purpose.

Vagrant was chosen for being able to create the cluster either on linux, windows and mac hosts.

## Prequirements
- Vagrant : https://www.vagrantup.com/downloads.html
- VirtualBox : https://www.virtualbox.org/wiki/Downloads

## Default provisioning
Vagrant up will provide 2 Ubuntu Xenial VMs for a kubernetes cluster with these features by default :
- Kubernetes control plane v1.7.1
- Weave network cni v2.0.0 
- Kubernetes Dashboard v1.8.1
- Heapster v1.5.0 
- Helm v2.7.2

## Kubeconfig
After installation, a copy of the admin.conf generated by kubeadm is available on the host in the ./kubeconfig directory.

Even if kubectl can be used within the guests, it is suggested that you copy the admin.conf as config in your ~/.kube/ directory on the host to able to do kubectl proxy and kubectl port-forward per example.

Or you can simply execute:
```
export KUBECONFIG=`pwd`/kubeconfig/admin.conf
kubectl get nodes
````
And you should see:
```
NAME        STATUS    ROLES     AGE       VERSION
k8smaster   Ready     master    10m       v1.9.0
k8sworker   Ready     <none>    5m        v1.9.0
```
